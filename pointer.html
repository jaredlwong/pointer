      This is very interesting (and as has been pointed out in other comments,
      not exactly a new idea). I think its proper application, though, is in a
      tool for practicing reading, not for actually reading tests.

      One major thing this approach looses is the inherent non-linearity of
      text. If I miss a fact and want to back up a bit, or want to pause for a
      moment and think about something, I can (when reading) without even
      thinking about it. Even if this approach is faster overall, it makes
      reading more like listening to audio or watching a video; it's a big pain
      to rewind or pause.

      Secondly, this is actually slower than true speed reading or skimming
      because it forces you to read every word. Truly accomplished readers will
      often read material at a very superficial level, only dipping in and
      reading consistently when they encounter a novel concept. Essentially, they
      can use semantic compression to increase their reading speed by only
      bothering to read what they find to be relevant. This operates on every
      level, from the page to the chapter to the paragraph to the sentence. It
      isn't perfect, of course, but it's always possible to back up if one finds
      crucial information has been missed.

      Finally, even though this tool is truly excellent for breaking the
      subvocalization habit that hampers most slow readers, once you learn how to
      read without subvocalizing it becomes a bit redundant. For example, looking
      at Spritz, I cranked the speed to 500. It felt pretty good, like I was
      reading fast. Then I went and took a traditional reading speed test and
      clocked in at 700wpm, with 95% comprehension. So I'm not sure my overall
      speed is better with Spritz.

      That said, I'll probably keep coming back to this or technologies like
      this, now that I'm aware of them. They seem a really good way to force
      oneself into the speed-reading mindset - I have a feeling that doing this
      for 60 seconds before a normal reading session would improve reading speed
      substantially.
